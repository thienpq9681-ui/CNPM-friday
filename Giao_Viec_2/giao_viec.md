- Swagger docs generated and accessible
- Zero CORS errors
- Team reports no API-related blockers

**Critical checks:**
- [ ] Database connection pooling working

**Công việc:**
- [ ] Create DAO layer: `app/dao/topic_dao.py`
- [ ] Implement batch queries (reduce N+1 problem)
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed topics
- [ ] Optimize topic list query (pagination + filtering)
- [ ] Add relationship loading strategy
- [ ] Test performance improvement

**Success criteria:**
- Topic list query returns in <100ms
- No N+1 queries in logs
- Caching reduces duplicate queries by 50%+

**Code pattern:**
```python
class TopicDAO:
    async def get_topics_with_evaluations(self, skip, limit):
        # Load topics with evaluations eager-loaded
        # Use joinedload to avoid N+1
        pass
```

**Tài liệu tham khảo:**
- CRITICAL_FIXES.md (section: Query optimization)
- CODE/backend/dao_examples/ (if available)

- [ ] Implement team deletion (cascade delete validation)
- [ ] Create endpoint: `GET /api/v1/teams/{id}/members` (with roles)
- [ ] Create endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/teams/{id}/members/{member_id}` (update role)
- [ ] Test cascade behavior

**Success criteria:**
- Team members can have different roles
- Role-based permissions enforced
- Delete team removes all related data
- No orphaned records

**New endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/teams/{id}/members` (list with roles)

- [ ] Define task status workflow (Todo → In Progress → Review → Done)
- [ ] Add validation: only valid status transitions allowed
- [ ] Implement task assignment (only to team members)
- [ ] Add task dependency support
- [ ] Create endpoint: `GET /api/v1/sprints/{id}/tasks` (with status filter)
- [ ] Test workflow edge cases

**Success criteria:**
- Task status transitions work correctly
- Invalid transitions rejected (422 error)
- Task assignments validated
- No "unassigned" tasks allowed

**Status workflow:**
```
Todo → In Progress → Review → Done
            ↓
       Blocked (with reason)
```

**New endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/sprints/{id}/tasks?status=in_progress`
- `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{id}/assign` (assign to member)
- `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{id}/status` (change status with validation)

**Tài liệu tham khảo:**
- CRITICAL_FIXES.md (section: Task workflow)
- app/models/all_models.py (Task model)

## 🚨 Common Issues in Phase 2

**Issue:** FE dashboard shows empty (no data from API)  
→ Check browser console for errors  
→ Verify API endpoint URL  
→ Check if auth token is being sent

**Issue:** API returns 401 (Unauthorized)  
→ Token might be expired (15 min timeout)  
→ Re-login and try again  
→ Check Authorization header format

**Issue:** CORS error in browser  
→ Make sure backend CORS is configured for `http://localhost:3000`  
→ Restart backend: `docker-compose restart backend`

**Issue:** Task status update not working  
→ Check if user is team member  
→ Verify task ownership  
→ Check task status workflow rules

**Issue:** Team delete fails  
→ Check if cascade delete is configured  
→ Verify no constraint violations  
→ Check database logs

## ✅ Khi xong Phase 2

Sau khi tất cả critical fixes completed + 2 FE dashboards fully integrated:

1. Run full end-to-end test (Flow 1, 2, 3)
2. Check database for data integrity
3. Document any remaining technical debt
4. Mở file `Giao_Viec_2/PHASE3_PLAN.md`
5. Bắt đầu Phase 3 planning

**Chúc bạn làm việc vui vẻ! 🚀**  
*Phase 2 là giai đoạn ổn định cơ sở hạ tầng. Làm kỹ để Phase 3 smooth! 💪*
